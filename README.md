Question : Enter a Roman Number as input and convert it to an integer. (Example: IX = 9)

Firstly Lets Understand the Question in detail : Imagine you're dealing with ancient Roman numbers, which are represented using letters: I, V, X, L, C, D, M. Each letter represents a specific value: I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L is 50, C is 100, D is 500, and M is 1000. Here, The task is to write a program that takes a Roman number as input (like IX, XV, XL, or CIX) and converts it into a regular number (integer). So, if someone enters 'IX', your program should recognize it as 9.

Let's Understand the Coding Part now :

import java.util.HashMap;  =  This line tells the computer that we want to use a special tool called HashMap, which helps us store data in pairs.

public class RomanToInteger {  =  This line creates a special instruction manual for the computer, called a class. This class is named "RomanToInteger".

public static int romanToInt(String s) {  =  Here, we're defining a set of instructions (a function) inside our manual. This function will convert Roman numerals to regular numbers. It takes a Roman numeral as input (a string) and will give us back a regular number (an integer).

HashMap<Character, Integer> romanMap = new HashMap<>();  =  We create a storage box (called a HashMap) to keep track of Roman numerals and their corresponding values. For example, 'I' is 1, 'V' is 5, and so on. We use this box to look up values while converting Roman numerals.

int result = 0;
int prevValue = 0;   =  We set up two special places (variables) in the computer's memory. result will hold our final answer (the converted number), and prevValue will remember the value of the previous Roman numeral we looked at.

for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {  =  Here, we start counting from the last letter of the Roman numeral and move backward towards the first letter.

int value = romanMap.get(s.charAt(i));  =  We look at the current Roman numeral (at position i), check our instruction manual (HashMap), and find out its value (for example, 'V' is 5).

if (value < prevValue) {
    result -= value;
} else {
    result += value;
}  =  We compare the current numeral's value with the previous one. If the current one is smaller than the previous one, we subtract its value from our result (because it's a special case in Roman numerals). Otherwise, we add its value to our result.

prevValue = value;  =  We remember this numeral's value for the next loop iteration.

return result;  =  Finally, we give back the total result (the converted number).

public static void main(String[] args) {
    String romanNumeral = "IX"; // Change this to the input Roman numeral
    int integerNum = romanToInt(romanNumeral);
    System.out.println(romanNumeral + " in Integer: " + integerNum);
}   =   In this part, we're saying, we want to test our conversion function." We provide a Roman numeral ("IX" in this case) and use our romanToInt function to convert it. 
Then, we print the converted number to the screen. So, if you change romanNumeral to any other Roman numeral, the program will convert and display the corresponding regular number.
